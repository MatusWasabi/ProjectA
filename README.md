The plan was to made a rouge-like card building game that player has to combine the elemental cards to create spells and use the spells to fight with enemies from area to area. 

There are 2 main features of this game. One is player roaming in the map choosing their path to adventure. And another is combat system when fighting the enemy. 

Before the programming begin, we plan and design the game. The designer design combat system, variation of cards, weakness and resistance of enemy mechanics. Then the programmer design the code structure using UML diagrams in order to achieve loosely coupled system that will allow robust and extensive development

During the development, the programmers have research many techniques that are suitable for the problems. The techniques practised are SOLID principle, abstract class, Unity Event (Observer pattern), interfaces, Unity New Input sytem, Scriptable object and Scriptable as Event Relayer.
PS. The resources learnt will be linked down below.

Within a week, this project has pushed the team to explore and learn many new knowledge that improve skills in game development. 

Team: 
- Game Designer: Kan Somchariya
- Game Programmer: Matus Yaowvasrisuwan
