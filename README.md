# Molecular Spells!

**April 2024**

**Description:**
Molecular Spells is a deckbuilding game developed with Unity during a week-long game jam. The game was created by a team of three members: one game designer and two game programmers.

**Game Overview:**
The objective of the game is to create a roguelike card-building experience where players combine elemental cards to cast spells and use them to defeat enemies as they progress through various areas.

## Key Features:
1. **Exploration:** Players roam the map and choose their adventure paths.
2. **Combat:** Players engage in battles using a unique combat system designed with diverse card variations, enemy weaknesses, and resistance mechanics.

## Development Process:
Before coding, the team meticulously planned and designed the game:
- The game designer focused on the combat system, card variations, and enemy mechanics.
- The programmers developed the code structure using UML diagrams to ensure a loosely coupled system, promoting robust and extensible development.

During development, the programmers researched and implemented various techniques:
- SOLID principles
- Abstract classes
- Unity Event (Observer pattern)
- Interfaces
- Unity's New Input System
- Scriptable Objects and Scriptable Objects as Event Relayers

## Outcome:
In just one week, the project challenged the team to explore and acquire new knowledge, significantly enhancing their game development skills.
